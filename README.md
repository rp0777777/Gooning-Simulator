<h1>Gooning Simulator: A Game for Goofs</h1>
Let's get one thing straight: Gooning Simulator is not what you think. Seriously. This game is a glorious exercise in absurdity, created just for fun. It’s a ridiculous, minimalist experience that proves you don't need a complex story or high-end graphics to have a good time.

In this game, your mission is simple: press the spacebar. With each press, a mysterious white, jelly-like substance appears. That’s it. There are no levels, no enemies, and no hidden secrets—just you, the spacebar, and a growing pile of goop.

This is a game made purely for laughs and entertainment. It’s a parody of a genre and a bizarrely satisfying way to spend a few minutes. If you’re a person who appreciates a truly strange and funny experience, then welcome to the club.
<h1>A Note From the Developer</h1>
You might see the title, Gooning Simulator, and think to yourself, "What kind of person makes a game like this?" I get it. The truth is, I'm not that kind of bad person. This game isn't a reflection of anything other than my own quirky sense of humor.

I made this game as a parody, a joke, and a lighthearted jab at the absurdity of some simulators out there. It's a game made for a laugh, nothing more. Think of it less as a "gooning" and more as "goofing" off. It's meant to be seen in a fun, entertaining way, and I hope you enjoy it as the silly, simple game it was always intended to be.
