You might see the title, Gooning Simulator, and think to yourself, "What kind of person makes a game like this?" I get it. The truth is, I'm not that kind of bad person. This game isn't a reflection of anything other than my own quirky sense of humor.

I made this game as a parody, a joke, and a lighthearted jab at the absurdity of some simulators out there. It's a game made for a laugh, nothing more. Think of it less as a "gooning" and more as "goofing" off. It's meant to be seen in a fun, entertaining way, and I hope you enjoy it as the silly, simple game it was always intended to be.
